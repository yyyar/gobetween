#  # (?P<host>...),
#  # (?P<port>...),
#  # (?P<weight>...),
#  # (?P<priority>...)
#  # All another captured groups will be ignored
#  # As default regexp plain discovery use (?P<host>\S+):(?P<port>\d+)(\sweight=(?P<weight>\d+))?(\spriority=(?P<priority>\d+)),
#  # so you can use responce like "0.0.0.0:1234, weight=0, priority=1/n0.0.0.0:4321 weight=1 priority=0"
